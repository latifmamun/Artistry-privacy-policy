                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Thank you for using <strong>Artistry</strong>! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("App").</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p><strong>We collect NO personal data.</strong> Artistry is designed to work completely offline and locally on your device.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drawing files (.png) are saved only in your device's internal storage or gallery (you choose).</li>
                    <li>No account, login, or email is required.</li>
                    <li>No analytics, tracking, or crash reporting tools are used.</li>
                    <li>No data is ever sent to any server.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Permissions Explained</h2>
                <p>The app requests the following permissions only when you use specific features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Storage / Photos & Media</strong> – Required to save your artwork to Gallery or load images from your device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Read/Write External Storage</strong> (Android 12 and below) – Same purpose as above.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can deny these permissions — the app will still work for drawing, but saving/loading from gallery will be disabled.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>4. No Data Sharing</h2>
                <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or transmit any user data to third parties because no data is collected.</p>
            </section>
