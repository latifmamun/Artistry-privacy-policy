                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Thank you for using <strong>Artistry</strong>! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("App"). The App primarily operates offline, but it includes advertisements served by Google AdMob.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>2. Information Collected by the App Itself</h2>
                <p>The App itself collects <strong>NO personal data</strong>. Artistry is designed to work mostly offline and locally on your device.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drawing files (.png) are saved only in your device's internal storage or gallery (you choose).</li>
                    <li>No account, login, or email is required.</li>
                    <li>No analytics, tracking, or crash reporting tools are used by the developer.</li>
                    <li>No data collected by the App is sent to any server.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>3. Advertisements (Google AdMob)</h2>
                <p>The App displays advertisements served by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, a third-party advertising service. Google AdMob may collect certain data automatically to serve personalized advertisements, for analytics, and fraud prevention. This may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Device identifiers (such as Advertising ID)</li>
                    <li>IP address</li>
                    <li>User interactions with ads</li>
                    <li>Diagnostic and performance information</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data is used by Google to provide interest-based (personalized) advertising. We do not control the data collected by AdMob. For more details on how Google uses this information, please review:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
                    <li>How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising or reset your Advertising ID in your device settings (Settings > Google > Ads on Android).</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>4. Permissions Explained</h2>
                <p>The app requests the following permissions only when you use specific features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Storage / Photos & Media</strong> – Required to save your artwork to Gallery or load images from your device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Read/Write External Storage</strong> (Android 12 and below) – Same purpose as above.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can deny these permissions — the app will still work for drawing, but saving/loading from gallery will be disabled.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>5. No Data Sharing by the Developer</h2>
                <p>We (the developer) do not share, sell, rent, or transmit any user data to third parties, as no personal data is collected by the App itself. Data collected by Google AdMob is governed by Google's policies.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Artistry is safe for all ages and does not target children. The App itself collects no personal information. However, since it displays personalized ads via AdMob, it is not directed at children under 13 (or the applicable age in your region). We comply with COPPA and GDPR-K requirements.</p>
